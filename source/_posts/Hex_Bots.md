# Hex Bot

Hex Game (Hex): Hex is a two-player abstract strategy game played on a hexagonal grid. The objective of the game is for each player to create an unbroken chain of their own pieces from one side of the hexagonal board to the opposite side. The two sides are typically labeled as "Blue" and "Red," and the first player to connect their sides wins. Hex is known for its deep strategy and mathematical complexity.
