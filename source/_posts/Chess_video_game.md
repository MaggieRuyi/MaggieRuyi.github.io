# Chess Video Game
---
## Rules of the game to be implemented
This chess game, will implement a subset of the rules of chess including:
1.The initial setup as defined in the Rules of Chess wikipedia page.
2.All the basic moves.
3.The game ends when a king is captured or one player resigns.
4.Note that the notation for the coordinates is different in our game. The original game is a to h on the X axis (left to right) and 8 to 1 on the Y axis (top to bottom), while in our case the latter should be 1 to 8 from the top to the bottom. 

For example, a simple implementation of this might look as follows:
