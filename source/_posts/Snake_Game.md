# Snake Game

## Rules of the game to be implemented
The Snake game is a classic and simple video game in which the player controls a snake that moves around a confined playing area, trying to collect food items while avoiding collisions with the walls of the playing area and the snake's own tail. Here's a basic explanation of how the game works:

1.Objective: The primary objective of the game is to eat as much food as possible to make the snake grow longer. The game continues until the snake collides with the wall or itself.

2.Game Elements:

  Snake: The player controls a snake, typically represented as a line or a chain of connected segments. The snake starts as a short line and gradually grows longer as it consumes food.
  Food: Food items appear at random positions within the playing area. When the snake "eats" a food item, it gets longer, and a new food item appears elsewhere in the arena.

3.Controls: The player can control the snake's direction using arrow keys (or other input methods). The snake can move up, down, left, and right.

4.Gameplay: As the game begins, the snake starts moving in a specific direction. The player's task is to change the snake's direction to guide it toward the food items. When the snake eats food, it grows longer, making it more challenging to avoid collisions.

5.Game Over: The game ends when one of the following conditions is met:

  The snake collides with the walls of the playing area.
  The snake collides with itself (by running into its own body).

6.Scoring: The player's score is usually based on the number of food items the snake eats. The longer the snake gets, the higher the score.
