# A Fuzzy Logic-based Washing Machine

## Fuzzy Logic

A Fuzzy Logic-based washing machine is equipped with an artificial intelligence (AI) system that uses Fuzzy Logic to optimize the washing process. Fuzzy Logic is a mathematical approach that allows the machine to make decisions based on "fuzzy" or imprecise data, making it well-suited for washing machines.

For example, a simple implementation of this might look as follows:
